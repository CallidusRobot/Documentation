# CAD
## TODO: Design
- Battery holder

## Remarks
- Magnetometer and accelerometer should be on-axis and away from electric/magnetic fields
- Battery should be easy and tool-less to remove
- PCB should be upside-down and have USB-connector on the right side
- ToF view should be un-obstructed
- RFID should be mounted as far away from ground as possible
- Speaker could be part of inner frame assembly (pointing itself down) towards the edge and be slotted in rails, before the frame is installed
- Battery could also be part of the inner frame assembly by being put in a well, where it just rests (perhaps with top cover)

## TODO: Print
- Top cover with DMD, accelerometer and magnetometer mounts (1x)
- Cannon base (1x)
- WS2812 Cannon (1x)
- Camera/ToF assembly (3x)
- Motor/RFID/Line sensor assembly (1x)

## Done
- Outer frame
- Diffusor
- Triggers (Home and Power-ups)
- Inner frame with PCB and speaker holder
- Cannon diffusor
